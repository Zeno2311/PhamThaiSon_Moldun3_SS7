                <span class="this">This is the second item's accordion body.</span> It is hidden by default, until the collapse
                plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style
                each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also
                worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <span class="codeone">.accordion-body</span>, though the
                transition does limit
                overflow.
